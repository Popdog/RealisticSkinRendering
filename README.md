				* * * * PURPOSE * * * *

This aim of this project is to create a realistic rendering of human skin (and, using the same principles,
other organic materials. I wrote it as my final project for CAP5725 at UCF in Fall 2017. The model used
in this project is actress Emily O'Brien, and all of the resources used are available for free at
http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/DigitalEmily/.


				* * * *  SETUP  * * * *

No installation is required for this code, although it needs to be run on a local server, otherwise it will
not render (I believe this is for security reasons, since the code utilizes the graphics card).


				* * * *   USE   * * * *

Click and drag to rotate the rendered face and look at it from different angles. The GUI element allows you
to toggle the blur, transparent light, and specular light effects on and off.
